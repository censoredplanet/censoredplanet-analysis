# Base Tables

These tables are created using the original censored planet json data, plus some
[additional data sources](../pipeline/metadata/).

## Table names

There is one table for each scan type.

- `firehook-censoredplanet:base.echo_scan`
- `firehook-censoredplanet:base.discard_scan`
- `firehook-censoredplanet:base.http_scan`
- `firehook-censoredplanet:base.https_scan`

## Partitioning and Clustering

The tables are time-partitioned along the `date` field.

The tables are clustered along the `country` and then `asn` fields.

## Original Data Format

The Censored Planet data is stored in .json files with one measurement per line.
The measurements look like this:

```
{ "Server": "1.1.1.1",
  "Keyword": "example.com",
  "Retries": 4,
  "Results": [
    {
      "Sent": "GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com",
      "Received": "HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable",
      "Success": false,
      "Error": "Incorrect echo response",
      "StartTime": "2020-04-29T07:29:46.139500633-04:00",
      "EndTime": "2020-04-29T07:29:46.490678827-04:00"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "Blocked": true,
  "FailSanity": false,
  "StatefulBlock": false
}
```

## Table Format

The json data is processed into a flat table format which looks like this.
